We don’t have any documentation on frameworks, but you can refer to this repository as a template for all the dev frameworks -  https://github.com/RoyalAholdDelhaize/pdl-fulfillment-cf-access-manager/tree/mainFor development environment -  IDE - IntelliJ, DB visualizer (for informix tables), Datagrip (for postgres). Wiremock (for api stubbing for unit tests), flyway (for DB setup and migrations), emeddedpostgres (for DB testing in Junits)For code standards -

jacoco for test coverage (we maintain a 85% test coverage standard)
checkstyle (we use the latest google standards as-is)
PMD for best practices code hygiene checks (in addition to sonarqube)
java version 17 (this is updated with time as other latest java versions are released and have been stabilized over at least an year)

For CF Equipment Mgmt architecture - We have the two confluence pages I shared with you - Still working on completing them

Hope this helps
